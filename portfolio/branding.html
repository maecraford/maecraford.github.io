                     For my Junior year I chose to concentrate on Branding. 
One of the projects we have had is to choose a current brand that is failing and rebrand it. I chose the family favorite JELL-O. 
<br>
<br>
I looked into a lot of JELL-Oâ€™s current branding and spent time seeing where they were failing and how I could change that. I found the company was spending too much time marketing to children. As sugary treats from the past I felt that they had a better market with people between the ages of 18-35. I decided to re-brand their packaging with a more sophiticated feeling to it. 
<br>
<br>
I decided to re package three of the most popular JELL-O flavours. I also created a fictional line of JELL-O Mystery to add a new item to the brand that would catch 
attention. The third item I chose to focus on was the
 already marketed JELL-O Play. It is a mold set for
 building with and while I loved the idea I felt that it needed a cleaner look, much like the other boxes.

              <p>GNARFEST is a fictional free ski competition sponsored by Pabst Blue Ribbon. I created this branding experiment during my senior year at parsons. I spent the spring semester in Park City, Utah and was very inspired by the atmosphere to create works of branding.  </p>

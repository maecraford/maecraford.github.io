                       Cultured Stickers was a company founded the summer of 2016. When I met Molly Wu at MICA Pre-College we instantly connected over our shared love of coffee and stickers. By the time Pre-College had ended we not only had an amazing friendship but also the start to a pretty great company. Over the course of the next two years we put out a total of around 60 different stickers. 

                       <br><br>

                       All of the designs were created by the two of us and also manfuactured by us. We sold them through Etsy and found a great following of people who loved stickers just as much as we do. We got orders from around the world and we got orders of all different sizes.
                       <br><br>

When the time for college came Molly and I decided to scale back the company to only sell a selection of ten stickers. While we were still recieving orders it became secondary to our school work. By the time sophmore year started, neither Molly or I had the time or space to continue creating and selling the stickers. We chose to close up shop in October of 2018, two years after we began.

                                <p> During my Sophmore year at Parsons I was assigned a project in which we were instructed to create a booklet with three perameters.
<br><br>
1. It has to include an interview with another classmate
<br>
2. It has to include a recipe
<br>
3. It has to include a horoscope
<br><br>
I struggled for some time with the formot of this book. I did many hands on collage iterations in order to figure out exaclty what I wanted. In the end I created a minimalist coloring book inspired booklet. In the interview with my classmate Asa I wanted to focus on certain questions that I ask in order to get to the "essence" of a person in my mind. The pesto recipe represents home to me, its an old recipe that I have been making my whole life. Instead of a horoscope I decided to add a fortune cookie to the cover. The title of the booklet, Cognitive, is one of my favorite words to me it brings to mind the necessity to constantly be thinkging and learning from the world around you.
The first verion of the booklet that I produced was printed out in outline in black and white. I then colored it in with colored pencil and scanned it in. I printed the final copy on thick white paper.</p>

               <p> This simple square book was another product of my editorial independent study Junior year. In this book I was exploring the confinements of useing only the color blue. I collected images from the internet and from my own camera roll to create an experience of textures and times of day through nature collages. Before cutting up or laying out any of the pages I converted every photo to be in blue tones. I loved the final piece which moves easily between abstract landscapes, causing the viewer to pause at the beautiful image and contemplate what it truly is.  </p>

                                   This design piece was created as part of a collection of egg related articles. While most of the articles were written about chicken eggs, I decided to choose an article written about salmon roe. The article I chose was one written about salmon milking. I chose it because it was on an interesting topic and it was also a shorter article which allowed for me to play with the space I had more.

This particular design went throught many different changes to end up where it is now. Once I had the overall layout put together it was all about the details. I went through multiple typefaces and colors till I found one that worked. It was also about finding the right way for all my text boxes to work together. I also spent time on the detailing for the fish.

n. a being of non-sexual and intellectual friendship<br><br>
During my frehsman year at Parsons I was asked to create a zine on any topic that interested me. I decided to create a piece about me and my friends at the time. I found it interesting the relationhsip between people in terms of how they view eachother. I asked my friends to each write a reference letter for me as if I was applying for a job somewhere. I did not tell them that the letter was for an art project but rather that it was for a job I was interviewing for. Then I drew a picture of each of them and juxtaposed the image and the text they sent to me on a spread in the zine.

Some of my friends knew the actual prompt and took the "assignment" of creating a refernce letter as more of a joke and their letters are a bit less proffesional than others. I didn't read or edit any of the letters before putting them on the page. They were all typeset by their creators. The final product was printed and a copy was given to each of the participants.</p>

               <p>This series of images and text were created as part of a class project for Advanced Typography during my Sophmore year at Parsons. I have always been fascinated by mythology and the monsters that fill them. For this project we were tasked with finding stories or articles that interested us and create a layout that complimented them. I chose to create a series of mythological monsters.

This particular design was actually very fun to create. I wanted the images to have a childrens book feel. I got the idea of creating images out of type from another typography class I had taken during Freshman year. I spent a lot of time figuring out which letter forms would best work for each monster. I created the whole piece using InDesign.</p>

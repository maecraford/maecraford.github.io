               	<p> The Quitter is a poem written in 1912 by Robert Service
            	<br><br>It was read to me when I was young by my Grandfather, along with many other of Robert Service's poems. <br><br> I came back to this poem in mid 2020 and it became the center of a few projects I worked on throughout my fall semester.</p>

          <p style="text-align: center;">The Quitter<br><br>
            <br>When you're lost in the Wild, and you're scared as a child,
   <br> And Death looks you bang in the eye,
<br>And you're sore as a boil, it's according to Hoyle
  <br>  To cock your revolver and . . . die.
<br>But the Code of a Man says: "Fight all you can,"
    <br>And self-dissolution is barred.
<br>In hunger and woe, oh, it's easy to blow . . .
    <br>It's the hell-served-for-breakfast that's hard.
<br><br>
<br>"You're sick of the game!" Well, now, that's a shame.
    <br>You're young and you're brave and you're bright.
<br>"You've had a raw deal!" I know — but don't squeal,
    <br>Buck up, do your damnedest, and fight.
<br>It's the plugging away that will win you the day,
    <br>So don't be a piker, old pard!
<br>Just draw on your grit; it's so easy to quit:
    <br>It's the keeping-your-chin-up that's hard.
<br><br>
<br>It's easy to cry that you're beaten — and die;
   <br> It's easy to crawfish and crawl;
<br>But to fight and to fight when hope's out of sight —
   <br> Why, that's the best game of them all!
<br>And though you come out of each gruelling bout,
   <br> All broken and beaten and scarred,
<br>Just have one more try — it's dead easy to die,
    <br>It's the keeping-on-living that's hard.</p>

                 <p>In order to make the video I interpreted certain lines of the poem into websites and daily tasks which I accomplish on my computer.

	The Cremation of Sam McGee

There are strange things done in the midnight sun
 <br>     By the men who moil for gold;
 <br>
The Arctic trails have their secret tales
<br>
      That would make your blood run cold;
      <br>
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
<br>
      But the queerest they ever did see
 <br>
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
<br>
      I cremated Sam McGee.

<div>
Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.
<br>
Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.
<br>
He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;
<br>
Though he'd often say in his homely way that "he'd sooner live in hell."
<br>
<br>
On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.
<br>
Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.
<br>
If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;
<br>
It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.
<br>
<br>
And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,
<br>
And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,
<br>
He turned to me, and "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I guess;
<br>
And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request."
<br>
<br>
Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:
<br>
"It's the cursèd cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.
<br>
Yet 'tain't being dead—it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;
<br>
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."
<br>
<br>
A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;
<br>
And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.
<br>
He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;
<br>
And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.
<br>
<br>
There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,
<br>
With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;
<br>
It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: "You may tax your brawn and brains,
<br>
But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains."
<br>
<br>
Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.
<br>
In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that load.
<br>
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring,
<br>
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows— O God! how I loathed the thing.
<br>
<br>
And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;
<br>
And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;
<br>
The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;
<br>
And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.
<br>
<br>
Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;
<br>
It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the "Alice May."
<br>
And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;
<br>
Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my cre-ma-tor-eum."
<br>
<br>
Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;
<br>
Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;
<br>
The flames just soared, and the furnace roared—such a blaze you seldom see;
<br>
And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.
<br>
<br>
Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;
<br>
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.
<br>
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;
<br>
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.
<br>
<br>
I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;
<br>
But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;
<br>
I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: "I'll just take a peep inside.
<br>
I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked"; ... then the door I opened wide.
<br>
<br>
And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;
<br>
And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: "Please close that door.
<br>
It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm—
<br>
Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been warm."
